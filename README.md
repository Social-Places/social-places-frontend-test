# Social Places Frontend Assessment

## Introduction

### Welcome prospective developer.

We are Social Places; a local marketing software agency that provides listings, reputation, bookings and social interactions across multiple platforms and channels.


## How to Proceed:

### Step 1 - Installation and setup

1. [Mirror](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository) the repository to your own account
    1. Please ensure your repository is private and that you, once complete, invite [Orestes Sebele/orestes-za](orestes@socialplaces.io), [James Filmer/socialPJames](james@socialplaces.io), [Nik Soebaran/N1K-5oc1alplac3s](nik@socialplaces.io) and [Matthew Henshilwood/matt-socialplaces](matthew@socialplaces.io) as collaborators
    2. Your assessment should be in separate branches to main/master
2. Clone the forked repository using your preferred git client
    1. While it is not imperative that a git client such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) or [Fork](https://git-fork.com/) is used,
       we highly recommend it.
3. Using Node and NPM start your project
    1. Run `npm install` in the project directory to download all the packages required to develop further
    2. After the installation run `npm run dev` to serve the application

### Step 2 - Frontend Brief

#### What to do?

Create a single page application that will offer the user a choice between either a "Cat" or a "Dog".
This choice should persist across a page reload, and the user should be able to change their choice of animal from one to the other.

After the user has selected their choice of animal, request a random image using the following two APIs and display the image on the page for the user:

- **Cat:** https://developers.thecatapi.com
- **Dog:** https://dog.ceo/dog-api

Use the supplied JS template classes to handle the page state and the calls to the external API.

We're looking for a well-designed page that respects modern conventions and demonstrates your attention to detail.

Your solution should:

- Follow contemporary design principles with clean, intuitive layouts
- Demonstrate responsive design that works seamlessly across devices
- Show thoughtful component organisation and code architecture
- Balance visual appeal with functional usability
- Demonstrate your understanding of modern frontend best practices
- Add tests where appropriate and/or applicable

Please feel free to add creative touches! 

### Step 3 - Completion

1. Submit the work in your **private** repository as described in Step 1
