# Social Places Frontend Assessment
##  Introduction
### Welcome prospective developer.
We are [Social Places](https://socialplaces.io); a local marketing software agency that provides
listings, reputation, bookings and social interactions across multiple platforms and channels.
For a great summary of the services we offer, please watch our
[2021 Product Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLQeB5pFpNw) [2:47] YouTube video.

### Developers
We are looking for developer talent to join our team. Here you'll find a
basic application outfitted in our tech stack but in a much more limited sense.
To do the test, you'll find a brief below containing some items to implement
and other sorts of tasks to complete.

## How to Proceed:

### Step 1 - Installation and setup

1. [Mirror](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository) the repository to your own account
    1. Please ensure your repository is private and that you, once complete, invite [Orestes Sebele/orestes-za](orestes@socialplaces.io) and [James Filmer/socialPJames](james@socialplaces.io) as collaborators
    2. Your assessment should be in separate branches to main/master
2. Clone the forked repository using your preferred git client
    1. While it is not imperative that a git client such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) or [Fork](https://git-fork.com/) is used,
       we highly recommend it.
3. Using Node and NPM start your project
    1. Run `npm install` in the project directory to download all the packages required to develop further
    2. After the installation run `npm run dev` to serve the application
