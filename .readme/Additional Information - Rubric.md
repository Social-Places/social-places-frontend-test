### Rubric

After submission, we will use the following rough rubric to evaluate your submission:

1. Vue:
    1. Follows perceived standards
        1. Tests perceptiveness (variable names, etc.)
        2. Ability to adjust to a new environment
    2. Produces quality code
        1. Code is readable
        2. Non-spaghetti like code
        3. Reusability
    3. Code navigation
    4. Task addressed accuracy
2. Git work:
    1. Was there an effort to use:
        1. Multiple commits
        2. Multiple branches
        3. Descriptive branch names and commit messages
        4. Followed readme instructions
3. Tests:
    1. Were tests written
        1. A loose metric - scaled by how much of the code and what is tested
4. Language:
    1. Where language is used does it conform to a professional level and standard
        1. Profanities will automaticall disqualify candidates
        2. Typos and misspelled words will tally against you, but not sway the marking heavily

It is important to note expectations vary based on the role you are applying for; Senior full-stack vs junior back-end will have different levels of critique. 
Technical abilities aside, we will focus on your character, willingness to adjust, and levels of effort in relation to your experience.
