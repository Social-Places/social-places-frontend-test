### Rubric

After submission, we will use the following rough rubric to evaluate the work:

1. Vue:
    1. Follows perceived standards
        1. Tests perceptiveness (variable names, etc...)
        2. Ability to adjust to a new environment
    2. Produces quality code
        1. Code is readable
        2. Non-spaghetti like code
    3. Code navigation
    4. Task addressed accuracy
2. Git work:
    1. Was there an effort to use:
        1. Multiple commits
        2. Multiple branches (per task)
        3. Descriptive branch names and commit messages
3. Tests:
    1. Were tests written
        1. A loose metric - scaled by how much of the code and what is tested
4. Language:
    1. Where language is used does it conform to a professional level and standard
        1. Things like swear words will get projects disqualified without further examination!
        2. Things like typos and misspelled words will tally against but not sway the marking heavily

It is important to note that we do not expect the best marks or even 50%, this test is character, willingness to adjust and to try.
